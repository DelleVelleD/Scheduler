Faculty Scheduler
=================

Description
-----------

This application is designed to help Georgia Gwinnett College faculty
members to efficiently register for courses. Besides a tool for the
benefit of professors, Scheduler is an information collector system that
requires an administrator(s). These individuals will be responsible for
operations of aggregation, modification and removal of courses and/or
sections. Additionally, in case of tribulations, they will be the ones
who decide which is the best way to accommodate schedules.
