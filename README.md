# ThunderCats - Faculty Scheduler Backend
Faculty Scheduler backend

# Description
The application allows instructors to provide a set of scheduling preferences to
a semi-automated system, which populates a semester schedule based on instructor
request and moderator approval. The scheduler is presented to the instructor.
We are working on the backend part of the application. Which includes the
automation of the scheduler, receiving input/output forms and resolving scheduling
conflicts
